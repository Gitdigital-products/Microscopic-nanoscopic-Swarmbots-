🧬 Project Overview

Microscopic & Nanoscopic Swarmbots is a multi‑scale, physics‑aligned swarm intelligence framework exploring how ultra‑small autonomous agents can coordinate through:

- Brownian‑dominated mobility  
- chemical & EM communication  
- distributed rule engines  
- emergent behavior classes  
- energy‑aware decision systems  

The project integrates nanorobotics, swarm intelligence, distributed systems, and biological inspiration into a unified research architecture.

---

🏗 System Architecture

The architecture is built on four layers:

1. Macro‑Orchestration Layer
Global objectives, mission constraints, emergent behavior monitoring.

2. Micro‑Coordination Layer
Local sensing, neighbor interactions, decentralized decision‑making.

3. Nano‑Actuation Layer
Physical actuation, chemical sensing, energy harvesting, Brownian‑biased motion.

4. Environment & Physics Layer
Stokes flow, diffusion fields, EM attenuation, nano‑scale forces.

⚙️ Simulation Framework

The simulation engine uses a dual‑loop kernel:

- Micro‑Timestep Loop (MTL) — physics, Brownian motion, diffusion  
- Macro‑Timestep Loop (MaTL) — emergent behavior, convergence, metrics  

Features include:

- stochastic physics  
- deterministic debug mode  
- hybrid simulation  
- numerical stability guarantees  
- behavior‑class validation

🧠 Swarm Intelligence

Swarm intelligence is defined through:

- Local Behavioral Rule Engine (LBRE)  
- Distributed State Propagation Layer (DSPL)  
- Emergent Behavior Convergence Model (EBCM)  
- Fault‑Tolerance & Redundancy Mesh (FTRM)  
- Energy‑Aware Decision Matrix (EADM)  

Behavior classes include:

- C1: Dispersion  
- C2: Aggregation  
- C3: Gradient Tracking  
- C4: Pattern Formation  
- C5: Cooperative Transport  
- C6: Self‑Repair
